## Assignment: Final-Project

The final part of your experiment, here you can go through your collected data and form ways of analyzing it. The methods you develop here will be used in your final presentation and paper!

## Working Remotely VS on Your Machine

You normally will be working on this with the github codespaces, but you can also git clone this repository to your own machine and work on it there. Committing and pushing as you go. If you do this I suggest you use VScode as it makes the whole process of cloning very simple, just a few button presses. In a new VScode window go to file browser and hit "Clone Repository," then paste in the link to this repository into the popup. You may need to add a few pip installs but this whole process is pretty straightforward. Datasets can be found here [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tAEYVsyA1et041O7yaOIXxrtWdk6QNEp?usp=sharing), download your groups file and add it to your personal repository (explanation in `final_analysis.ipynb`).

## Sharing Notebook and Code

We kindly ask you to not share any code given to you in the assignment outside of this class, make sure to keep any files used in the assignment between class members only.

## Getting Started

To begin or resume your assignment, simply click the "Code" button in the top right of your repository area. From there press the + button in the codespaces tab, setting up your codespace may take a few minutes. If you leave after setting the codespace up, you can resume it at any time through the same code menu. Once the codespace is set up make the changes you need, answer the questions and then you can submit in the Source Control tab, by staging your changes with the + button and then using the big green "commit" button with a commit message and then hitting the "Sync Changes" button that pops up afterwards. Feel free to submit as many times as you wish.
